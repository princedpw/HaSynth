Profs.\ Fisher and Walker have already been successfully collaborating with one another for the past few years in the areas of network programming and verification.  Fisher and Walker ... PADS ... Optician ...  Through these existing collaborations, the team already has a well honed working relationship. 

As we have done for our prior and ongoing collaborations, we will continue to hold weekly team-wide videoconference meetings.  This mechanism allows everyone to stay abreast of the activities at both universities and enables all students to take advantage of the broad knowledge and perspectives represented across the team.  In this way, the PIs truly co-advise all graduate students, regardless of their location, which in our experience produces stronger, higher-impact research.  
We also have frequent email discussions between meetings.  

Due to our existing collaborations we already have a shared Github repository for code, data, and publications.  We will continue to use this repository to share and maintain our research artifacts.

A timeline of the proposed work is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timeline}.
Given the backgrounds and interests of the PIs, we envision a natural
split in the research work.
