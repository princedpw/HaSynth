\section{Results from Prior NSF Support}
\label{sec:prior-support}

\noindent
{\bf David Walker, PI. NSF CNS-1111520, Intellectual Merit:}
In NSF CNS-1111520, \emph{High-Level Language Support for Trustworthy Networks}
(\$1,400,000, 08/11-07/16),
PI Walker and his collaborators developed new languages, interfaces
and systems for managing software-defined networks (SDNs).  
This project produced the Frenetic family
of network programming languages, the first high-level languages for
programming software-defined networks.  These languages, which include
Frenetic~\cite{frenetic}, 
Pyretic~\cite{pyretic},
NetKAT~\cite{netkat} and others, all adhere to the
\emph{principle of compositionality}, a key design element missing
from earlier network programming languages.  
%They also invented the
%notion of consistent network update~\cite{reitblatt+:consistent-updates},
%which ensures key safety invariants are preserved across network update.
Open source code for systems produced by this project is available
at \url{frenetic-lang.org}.
%
{\bf Broader Impacts:} 
The PIs held a well-attended summer school on network programming and 
verification for students and faculty. The
Pyretic programming language was used in Nick Feamster's popular
SDN MOOC; thousands of students and
network operators all over the US used it to learn principles of network
programming.  The PIs
also helped create the P4 switch configuration language~\cite{P4}, which is
becoming an industry standard.
