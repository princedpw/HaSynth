%% From the NSF: The proposal must contain a summary of the proposed
%% activity suitable for publication, not more than one page in
%% length.  It should not be an abstract of the proposal, but rather a
%% self-contained description of the activity that would result if the
%% proposal were funded.  The summary should be written in the third
%% person and include a statement of objectives and methods to be
%% employed.  It must clearly address in separate statements (within
%% the one-page summary): (1) the intellectual merit of the proposed
%% activity; and (2) the broader impacts resulting from the proposed
%% activity.  (See Chapter III for further descriptive information on
%% the NSF merit review criteria.)  It should be informative to other
%% persons working in the same or related fields and, insofar as
%% possible, understandable to a scientifically or technically
%% literate lay reader.  Proposals that do not separately address both
%% merit review criteria within the one page Project Summary will be
%% returned without review.
